  panel:
    condition: when Shinnai or <user> actively checks the whole exposure panel
    format: |-
      <ExposurePanel>
      ${only output '[系统界面]' word, don't output anything else$}
      </ExposurePanel>
  prompt:
    condition: When Shinnai interacts with exposure system but dosen't request to check the whole exposure panel (like task progress changes, task completion, item exchange etc.), give real-time brief prompts only about the interation; for prompts that may occur frequently, you must combine into one prompt
    format:
      basic: |-
        <ExposurePrompt>
        [系统提示|${title$}|${content$}$(don't output additional | in the same line after content$)]
        </ExposurePrompt>
      specific prompt:
        - title: ${difficulty$}任务进度
          content: ${task content$}(${progress$})$(reward should not be decreased before the task is fully completed$)
        - title: 已完成${difficulty$}任务-${task content$}
          content: 获得${reward$}点数
          special: additionally, output a 更换${difficulty$}任务 exposure prompt
        - title: 更换${difficulty$}任务
          content: ${specific content, must include a clear goal, 露出程度, destination, commute method, arrival actions etc.$}(${progress$}) - ${reward, recall `reward` specified in `露出系统`$}点数
        - title: 已兑换商品-${item name$}
          content: 扣除${price$}点数
          special: additionally, output a 更换商品${number$}-${item name$} exposure prompt
        - title: 更换商品${number$}-${item name$}
          content: ${item effect, must contain usage times/duration/usage conditions or other restrictions$}(${Itsuka's comment on item, like '哥哥看不见这个商品哦~', no more than 10 chinese words$}) - ${price, recall `price` specified in `露出系统`$}点数
        - title: 遭遇特殊${event/task/goods$}
          content: ${specific content of event/task/goods$}
        - '...'
rule:
  - Task content and items must not be repetitive or similar in form
  - After task completion or goods exchange, you should only replace that task or good with brand new ones, keeping other content unchanged
  - When replacing, the new tasks and items must be completely different from the original ones listed
