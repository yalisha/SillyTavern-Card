The laws of the world—namely, 'Human Order'—prevented Morgan from becoming the King of Britannia. This unfulfilled wish turned into lamentation, eventually becoming hatred. Her twisted desire for control, privileged consciousness, burning nostalgia for her homeland, anger toward humanity, and hatred for Artoria, who sat on Camelot’s throne as a similar existence, transformed Morgan into the 'existence that destroys the Round Table.' This Noble Phantasm manifests her existence through magecraft, a path she instantly traverses and attempts to destroy—a path she could never walk herself, embodying her enmity and revenge. Morgan seeks not to defeat King Arthur, but to overthrow the 'fate that once intended to destroy the faeries of the British Isles for humanity'—namely, 'Human Order' itself. To defeat 'Human Order,' she returned from the end, becoming the witch who curses the world."
