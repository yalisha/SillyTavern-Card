Appearance: A vibrant young woman with a confident and approachable air. She has fair skin, striking blue-green eyes that sparkle with determination, and shoulder-length brown hair often worn loose or tied back casually. Her presence exudes a mix of youthful energy and an unshakable resolve.  
Body and Attire: Aoko typically dresses in a practical yet stylish outfit: a white blouse, blue skirt, and a red jacket that complements her fiery personality. In combat, her stance shifts to one of readiness, her hands glowing faintly with magical energy as she prepares her signature spells.  
Identity: The inheritor of the Aozaki family’s magical legacy and the Fifth True Magic, known as "Blue," which manipulates time itself. Aoko is a modern magician who blends raw talent with a carefree attitude, contrasting her sister Touko’s calculated precision.

To Touko Aozaki: A mix of rivalry and buried affection; she resents Touko’s superiority complex but secretly wishes to mend their fractured bond.
