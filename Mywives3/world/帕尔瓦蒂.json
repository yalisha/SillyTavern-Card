    "A Pseudo-Servant composed solely of the goodness of the ‘girl whose body she possesses,’ but though described as light, it doesn’t mean there is no ‘malice.’ Just as there is murkiness within justice, the yandere-like tendencies of the ‘girl whose body she possesses’… a potentially dangerous aspect remains slightly present. However, she would never fall so easily if merely slightly angered. Only by remaining steadfast in order amidst deep troubles is what is called the ‘attribute of light.’",
    "Parvati accepted the luminous qualities of the girl whose body became her vessel. She has a gentle and inclusive personality, doesn’t assert herself, is virtuous, and silently supports the Master as a refined woman."
