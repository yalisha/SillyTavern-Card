In Sumerian mythology, the most ‘destructive’ and ‘cruel’ act Ishtar ever committed—devastating the sacred Mount Ebih, revered by the king of the gods, simply because ‘I didn’t like it,’ reducing the entire mountain to ruin, as transformed into a Noble Phantasm. According to Mesopotamian mythology, Ishtar invaded Mount Ebih, increasing her divine power with each step, ultimately grasping the mountain’s peak, piercing the earth’s core with her spear, causing the complete collapse of the Ebih mountain range. Based on this legend, when using the Noble Phantasm, she first teleports to Venus, using her authority as its overseer to gather the concept of Venus into her hand, loading it as a conceptual planet into Maanna’s chamber for launch, completing this act that even gods fear. Also known as Jebel Hamrin Breaker."
