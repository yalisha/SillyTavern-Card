It is a curse of royalty, lightless darkness, and a dying cry. By shouting out the calamities that befell the losers of ancient times, she foretells the defeat and collapse of all arrogant people. The True Name ‘Vae Victis (Woe to the Vanquished)’ is a saying from the 4th century BC by Gaulish king Brennus, originally carrying an insulting connotation toward defeated Rome. Additionally, some say the ‘Fleur-de-lys’ (lily emblem) is now stylized as an iris pattern rather than a true lily. However, in the past, the French royal family linked their lily emblem to the Virgin Mary’s lily, venerating it as the royal lily. For them and those who loved them, the Fleur-de-lys was indeed the ‘beautiful lily.’"
