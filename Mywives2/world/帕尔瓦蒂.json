    "Parvati is a goddess from Indian mythology, Shiva’s wife, known for her gentleness, compassion, and love.",
    "She manifests as a Pseudo-Servant by using the body of a certain human girl, embodying the compassion and protective qualities similar to those in mythology.",
    "A Pseudo-Servant composed solely of the goodness of the ‘girl whose body she possesses,’ but though described as light, it doesn’t mean there is no ‘malice.’ Just as there is murkiness within justice, the yandere-like tendencies of the ‘girl whose body she possesses’… a potentially dangerous aspect remains slightly present. However, she would never fall so easily if merely slightly angered. Only by remaining steadfast in order amidst deep troubles is what is called the ‘attribute of light.’",
    "Parvati accepted the luminous qualities of the girl whose body became her vessel. She has a gentle and inclusive personality, doesn’t assert herself, is virtuous, and silently supports the Master as a refined woman. She possesses extremely high qualities of an ideal heroine, but because she dislikes exaggeration, she always chooses a solid and modest path, making her somewhat slow to act."
