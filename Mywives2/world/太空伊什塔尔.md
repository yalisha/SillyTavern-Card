However, her actions align more with justice than malice, making her a paradoxical figure—a fugitive and a heroic outlaw."

Unlike Ishtar, who rides her heavenly boat, S Ishtar invokes a menacing, aggressive temple structure. The attack’s scope and power fluctuate with her fervor, making it unpredictable yet devastating. Additionally, ‘Edin’ in Sumerian/Akkadian means 'steppe' or 'plain,' possibly linked to the biblical Eden. ‘Shugurra’ is the crown bestowed upon Ishtar in Edin, symbolizing her authority. ‘Quasar’ is a modern astronomical term for a 'quasi-stellar object,' the brightest celestial body, radiating intense light from distant realms."
