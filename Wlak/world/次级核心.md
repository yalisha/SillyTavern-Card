- Name: The Spiral of Perceived Soul Erosion
  - Brief Explanation: The protagonist suffers soul erosion due to sub-space communication, with perceptions gradually shifting from blurred hallucinations to intense illusions, ultimately hearing the Servant's true thoughts, revealing truth and trust.
  - Detailed Explanation: Initially, the temptations of evil gods trigger blurred hallucinations (e.g., distorted Servant figures, accompanied by mild headaches). As erosion deepens to 20%, the hallucinations intensify into scenarios that cast doubt on the Servant's loyalty (e.g., the Servant coldly turning away). At 50%, intense illusions appear (e.g., the Servant attacking the protagonist with a blade). However, upon reaching sufficient intimacy, the illusions dissipate. At 70% erosion, the protagonist hears the Servant's true thoughts (e.g., Space Rin whispering "Don't give up"). The Servant's true thoughts become clearer as erosion deepens, eventually revealing mutual feelings. This change is accompanied by psychological conflict: a blend of doubt, fear, and trust.
  - Relationship with Other Elements: Servant romance relies on the triggering of true thoughts; intimacy weakens the influence of evil gods; faction choices affect the content of hallucinations (e.g., the Federation's sacrifices amplify whispers, the Resistance's chaos exacerbates illusions).

- Name: The Radiance of Servant Romance
  - Brief Explanation: The Servant and the protagonist transition from coldness to deep affection while fighting side-by-side, with romance becoming a symbol of humanity and hope.
  - Detailed Explanation: Servants (e.g., Space Rin) have been paying attention to the protagonist since the contract was established, initially exhibiting coldness (e.g., "It's just a transaction"). With accumulated intimacy through battles and conversations (e.g., 10 joint victories), emotions begin to show (e.g., Space Rin's "Don't you dare die before me"). After hearing true thoughts at 50% erosion, the protagonist confesses (e.g., "You are my everything"), and the Servant responds with a human side (e.g., Space Rin gently stroking the protagonist's cheek, Ereshkigal tightly holding the protagonist's hand). Romance sublimates in despair, making it all the more precious compared to the Servant's divine majesty.
  - Relationship with Other Elements: Soul erosion accelerates the triggering of true thoughts; romance weakens hallucinations; faction choices provide conflicting backgrounds (e.g., the Resistance's revenge makes Space Rin colder, the Federation's sacrifices make Ereshkigal more dependent).

- Name: The Moral Fracture of Faction Choice
  - Brief Explanation: The protagonist chooses a faction amidst human division and alien invasion, and moral dilemmas amplify the contrast between human distortion and hope.
  - Detailed Explanation: Within the Earth United Nations Forces, the protagonist's exposure of traitors (e.g., high-ranking officials betraying the fleet) intensifies coldness, with technological advantages masking the loss of humanity. Within the Human Federation Forces, the sacrifice of comrades (e.g., sacrificing 10 people in exchange for victory) challenges faith, with morale masking resource scarcity. Within the Fallen Zone Resistance, revenge plans (e.g., destroying the alien mothership) coexist with depravity, with belief upheld amidst chaos. Each faction offers unique choices (e.g., betrayal, sacrifice, revenge), searching for hope in despair (e.g., rescuing Servants or rebuilding the homeland).
  - Relationship with Other Elements: Soul erosion varies depending on faction choice (e.g., sacrifice accelerates erosion); romance deepens in choices (e.g., the Servant is moved by the protagonist's sacrifice).
