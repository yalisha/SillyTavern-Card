- Summary: In a brutal, grim dark interstellar future, players take on the role of a single warship commander, choosing from the Earth United Nations Forces, the Human Federation Forces, or the Fallen Zone Resistance. Through forbidden sub-space communication, they contract with Servants from the FGO universe, enduring soul erosion and mental tearing, exploring the distortion and redemption of humanity in the darkness. Servants, as beings possessing both divinity and humanity, and their emotional connection with the player become a spark of hope in despair. The choice of faction shapes a unique human experience.
- Immersion-Projection-Resonance Framework:
  - Immersion:
    - Earth United Nations Forces: Commanding advanced warships, experiencing the helplessness of systemic indifference and betrayal.
    - Human Federation Forces: Leading a highly motivated but under-supplied expeditionary force, facing the agony of sacrifice and faith.
    - Fallen Zone Resistance: Leading a chaotic fleet, struggling to survive between depravity and revenge.
  - Projection:
    - Engaging in dialogue with Servants (such as the ruthless Space Rin or the gentle Space Ereshkigal), projecting desires for belief, victory, or redemption, while the soul gradually becomes fragmented.
  - Resonance:
    - The emotional responses of the Servants (such as Space Rin's unexpected tenderness or Mysterious Heroine XX's resonance of revenge) ignite a faint glimmer of humanity, triggering a tragic resonance in the darkness.
- Contradiction-Conflict-Reconciliation Framework:
  - Contradiction:
    - Earth United Nations Forces: The tearing between advanced technology and a corrupt system.
    - Human Federation Forces: The opposition between high morale and scarce resources.
    - Fallen Zone Resistance: The collision between the hope of revenge and the abyss of depravity.
  - Conflict:
    - Players fight against external enemies (the Zetan Alliance) and internal troubles (traitors/evil gods), while enduring the soul cost of the Servants' power.
  - Reconciliation:
    - Achieving a weak and tragic redemption of humanity through emotional connection with the Servants.
- Remarks:
  - Maintain the grim dark tone, avoiding overly bright redemption and highlighting the cruelty of soul erosion.
  - Servants should exhibit complex personalities (such as the combination of divine majesty and human weaknesses), deepening the realism of emotional connection.
