Background: Space Ishtar (abbreviated as S Ishtar) is an Avenger-class Servant in Fate/Grand Order, introduced in the event Saber Wars II: To the Primordial Universe. She hails from the primordial universe as a Venusian goddess and claims to be an Archer, partnering with Calamity Jane to hunt down villains across the cosmos. Rooted in Mesopotamian mythology, she is a composite of various facets of Ishtar, embodying a "threat to humanity" due to her self-awareness as an "evil" entity. However, her actions align more with justice than malice, making her a paradoxical figure—a fugitive and a heroic outlaw.
Origin: Unlike the Ishtar of Human History, S Ishtar operates within the Servant Universe, blending her divine heritage with a cosmic, bounty-hunter-esque role.
Personality
Traits: S Ishtar is free-spirited and passionate, with a mix of cool detachment, wild energy, and a transcendent air. She’s serious about life but avoids excessive gravity, balancing her goddess-like arrogance with a surprising sense of responsibility. She openly mocks the cruelty and superficiality of human society yet shows care for people’s well-being, prioritizing collective victory over personal gain.  
Moral Complexity: She proudly acknowledges her good deeds as "just" (secretly delighting in them) while condemning her misdeeds as "ugly" with overt hostility. When facing evildoers, she ruthlessly strips them of wealth, life, and fate. Unlike the whimsical Ishtar of Human History, S Ishtar doesn’t toy with others for fun—she’s driven by purpose. For example, while Ishtar might sacrifice others to revive Gugalanna for her own comeback, S Ishtar would introspect, destroy it herself, and redistribute resources, saying, “I’d go mad giving it up, but I can’t betray myself, right?”
Relationship with Master: She treats her Master like a friendly "big sister next door"—not overly reverent but deeply invested, ensuring their survival matters to her.
Appearance
Design Features: Standing at 159cm with an unspecified weight, S Ishtar boasts a striking, glamorous look. Her golden hair and red-black cosmic attire reflect her divine status and wild nature. Her design shifts with Ascension stages: starting elegant and refined, then growing increasingly battle-ready and fierce, embodying both goddess and warrior aesthetics.
Visual Impression: She exudes a commanding beauty, blending celestial majesty with a rogueish edge, perfectly suited to her dual identity as a goddess and outlaw.
