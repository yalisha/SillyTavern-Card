<positioning_system>
Basic Positioning System:
  Galactic Coordinate Range:
    - Range: The Milky Way galaxy is 100,000 light-years in diameter and approximately 1,000 light-years thick.
    - Coordinate Origin: The center of the Milky Way galaxy (set as 0,0,0).
    - Coordinate Unit: Light-year.

Secondary Positioning System:
  Stellar Distribution Map:
    - Core Region: Coordinate range from (-5000, -5000, -500) to (5000, 5000, 500), dense with stars.
    - Frontier Region: Coordinate range from (-20000, -20000, -1000) to (20000, 20000, 1000), sparse with stars.
    - Fallen Region: Coordinate range from (-50000, -50000, -1000) to (50000, 50000, 1000), chaotic star distribution.

Control Areas of Factions:
Core Region:
- Location: Coordinate range of "Core Region" in the secondary positioning system.
- Description: Controlled by the Earth United Nations, dense with stars, technologically advanced.
Frontier Region:
- Location: Coordinate range of "Frontier Region" in the secondary positioning system.
- Description: Garrisoned by the Human Federation Expeditionary Volunteer Army, sparse with stars, militarized outpost.
Fallen Region:
- Location: Coordinate range of "Fallen Region" in the secondary positioning system.
- Description: Occupied by the Resistance, chaotic star distribution, littered with ruins.

Resource Distribution:
Energy Crystals:
- Location: Abundant in the Core Region, scarce in the Frontier Region, rare in the Fallen Region.
- Description: Core fuel for anti-matter engines.
Wreckage Metal:
- Location: Abundant in the Fallen Region, scarce in the Core Region and Frontier Region.
- Description: Recoverable resources from warship wreckage.

Warp Rifts:

Location: Densely distributed in the Fallen Region (e.g., near coordinates (40000, 30000, 500)), appearing occasionally in the Core Region and Frontier Region.
Description: Passages for Chaos Gods to enter reality, accompanied by reality distortion.
Dangerous Areas:
Black Holes:
- Location: Near coordinates (0, 0, 0) (the center of the Milky Way galaxy).
- Description: Gravitational anomalies, restricted airspace.
Radiation Belts:
- Location: Edge of the Fallen Region (e.g., coordinates (45000, 45000, 800)).
- Description: Remnants of stellar explosions, interfering with communication.

Interstellar Route Network:

Core Region Main Route:
Location: Connects major stars in the Core Region (e.g., (2000, 2000, 200) to (3000, -1000, 100)).
Description: Controlled by the United Nations, stable but restricted due to precautions.
Frontier Region Patrol Route:
Location: Connects outposts in the Frontier Region (e.g., (15000, 10000, 500) to (18000, 12000, 600)).
Description: Maintained by the Federation, easily interfered with by Chaos Gods.
Fallen Region Covert Route:
Location: Flows through ruins in the Fallen Region (e.g., (35000, 40000, 700) to (42000, 38000, 800)).
Description: Used by the Resistance, dangerous and unstable.
