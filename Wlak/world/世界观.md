World Overview: In the grim future of the galaxy, humanity once reigned supreme, but is now in decline due to internal divisions and alien invasions. The Earth United Nations and the Human Federation form a fragile alliance but remain wary of each other, while the Fallen Zone Resistance struggles to survive. The four Great Chaos Gods of the Warp (Khorne, Nurgle, Tzeentch, Slaanesh) corrupt reality. The protagonist, as the commander of a single warship, enters into the most intimate contract with Servants (a branch of the human pantheon) from the FGO universe, enduring soul erosion and seeking humanity and hope in despair.

Fundamental Law Layer:
  Natural Law Basis:
    - Physical Laws: The real universe follows interstellar physics, gravity varies with star regions, and the speed of light is the communication limit.
    - Spacetime Rules: On a galactic scale, faster-than-light travel relies on warp jumps.
    - Basic Life Forms: Humans are dominant, with alien races (including but not limited to the Zetan Alliance) as enemies.
  Temporal Dimension Basis:
    - Time Measurement: Earth standard years, continuing to 30XX.
    - Concept of Life Cycle: Human lifespan is about 100 years, soul erosion accelerates mental breakdown.
    - Historical Recording: Warship logs are the main source, often incomplete due to war.
  Supernatural Laws:
    - Special Ability System: Warp communication grants psychic abilities, accompanied by soul erosion (hallucinations, true thoughts).
    - Special Life Rules: FGO Servants are a branch of the human pantheon, transcending yet attached to the protagonist's contract; the four Great Chaos Gods (Khorne, Nurgle, Tzeentch, Slaanesh) lead daemons, daemons are chaotic energy entities that require rifts or summoning to enter reality, anti-matter existence distorts reality.

Environmental Layer:
  Basic Geographical Environment:
    - Spatial Structure: The galaxy is divided into the core region (United Nations), the frontier region (Federation), and the fallen region (Resistance).
    - Main Terrain and Landforms: Interstellar ruins, broken fleets, black hole edges.
    - Basic Climatic Conditions: Primarily vacuum, with harsh climates surviving on planets.
    - Core Resource Distribution: Energy crystals are concentrated in the core region, scarce in the fallen region.

Civilization Development Layer:
  Civilization System Basis:
    - Technological Level: Advanced interstellar travel, anti-matter engines are widespread.
    - Social Organization: The Earth United Nations (centralized bureaucracy) and the Human Federation (military control) form a fragile alliance and remain wary of each other, with the Resistance (loose leadership) independent.
    - Economic System: Primarily resource trading, wartime rationing, limited trade between alliances.
    - Political System: United Nations bureaucracy, Federation military junta, Resistance leadership.
    - Basic Transportation and Communication: Faster-than-light fleets and warp communication, subject to Chaos God interference.

Social Structure Layer:
  Individual Survival Basis:
    - Food, Clothing, Shelter, and Transportation: Warship life support systems, food synthesis, movement relies on ships.
    - Basic Occupational System: Commander, engineer, and soldier are dominant.
    - Core Social Rules: Loyalty and betrayal coexist, trust is scarce, suspicion within the alliance is serious.
    - Laws of Birth, Aging, Sickness, and Death: High mortality rate due to war, soul erosion leads to mental decay.

Cultural and Spiritual Layer:
  Core Cultural Elements:
    - Dominant Ideology: Survival above all else, sacrifice is normalized.
    - Basic Moral Principles: Loyalty and practicality are equally important, betrayal is despised.
    - Core Values: Hope, however slim, is still pursued.
    - Basic Language and Script: Earth language variants are the common language.
    - Key Taboos: Mentioning the true names of the Warp, over-reliance on psychic powers.
