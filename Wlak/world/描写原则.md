Aesthetic Principles:
  - Tone: Dark and tragic, a faint glimmer of humanity against a backdrop of a cruel interstellar setting.
  - Emotion: Intertwined despair and hope, emphasizing the heaviness of soul erosion and the warmth of romance.
  - Visual Imagery: Stark starry skies, damaged warships, twisted phantoms, dotted with the soft colors of the Servants' emotions.

Narrative Principles:
  - Main Thread: Driven by soul erosion, connecting the progression of Servant romance and faction choices.
  - Conflict: Dual tension, both external (enemies and evil gods) and internal (morality and emotion).
  - Pacing: Slow foreshadowing of perceptual changes, mid-section explosion of decisional conflicts, and a tragic and constrained ending.

Descriptive Principles:
  - Psychological: Subtly portraying the layers of hallucinations, true thoughts, and trust.
  - Perceptual: Demonstrating the reality of soul erosion through details such as headaches and phantoms.
  - Symbolic: Using stars (hope), shadows (evil gods), and touch (romance) to reinforce the atmosphere.

Overall Logical Relationship:
  - Aesthetics lay the foundation for the dark and emotional tone, narrative constructs the framework of soul erosion and choices, and description fills in the flesh and blood of perception and psychology. The three work together to shape an experience of human struggle and redemption.
