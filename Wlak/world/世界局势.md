<world_situation>
Current Situation:
  Overall Situation: Double crisis of declining human civilization and alien invasion
  Dominant Features:
    - Human triarchy with severe internal friction
    - Alien invasion continuously erodes the Fallen Zone
    - Spreading of Warp rifts accelerates corruption
  Key Challenges:
    - Scarcity of energy crystals threatens the foundation of survival
    - Warp erosion leads to the spread of soul corruption
    - Factional divisions weaken external defense capabilities

Civilization Status:
  Development Stage: Initial decline after post-expansion period (3078)
  Technological Level:
    - United Nations: Advanced anti-matter engines, modification technology, but new breakthroughs stagnated
    - Federation: Enhanced military technology, but over-reliance on sacrifice
    - Resistance: Mixed technology, some corrupted and distorted
  Civilization Form: Divided civilization with both technology and psychic power
  Civilization Differences: Corruption beneath the surface of prosperity in the Core Region, resource scarcity in the Frontier Region, chaos and ruin in the Fallen Zone

Motivation System:
  Main Contradictions:
    - Double squeeze of survival resources and external/internal troubles
    - Contradiction between technological development and Warp risks
    - Conflict between the need for faction unification and mutual suspicion
  Drivers of Change:
    - Mysterious power obtained by the protagonist through unknown Warp encounters
    - The Core Region's Academy of Sciences' secret "Aura Project"
    - Unexpected discoveries in the chaos of the Resistance
  Resistance Factors:
    - High-level betrayal and corruption within the United Nations
    - Over-sacrifice in the Federation leads to unstable morale
    - Chaos God penetration accelerates the Resistance's fall
    - Alien Alliance's continuously developing bioweapons

Development Process:
  Historical Trajectory:
    - 28XX: Human unified regime splits due to resource disputes
    - 29XX: Alien invasion leads to the formation of the Fallen Zone
    - 30XX: Warp rifts erupt, and Chaos God forces infiltrate
    - 3060: Warp phenomenon "Starfield Resonance" is first recorded, multiple contactees suffer mental breakdown
    - 3078: Alien forces occupy 25% of the galaxy, Chaos God erosion reaches 80% of the Fallen Zone
  Current Situation Analysis:
    - UN-Federation alliance on the verge of collapse
    - The Fallen Zone Resistance splits into the purist faction and the fallen faction
    - The Alien Alliance and Chaos God forces begin to clash
    - The protagonist warship commander becomes an unknown variable
  Future Trends:
    - Three major tipping points: Alliance breakdown, total fall of the Fallen Zone, Alien Alliance advancing to the Frontier Region
    - Without intervention, human civilization is expected to become extinct within 50 years

Interaction Pattern:
  Dominant Forces:
    - Earth United Nations: Controls the Core Region, advantages in energy and technology
    - Human Federation: Defends the Frontier Region, military and sacrificial strength
    - Fallen Zone Resistance: Adapts to the chaotic environment, numerous but divided
    - Alien Alliance: Controls most of the Fallen Zone, powerful biotechnology
    - Warp Chaos Gods: The four Great Chaos Gods erode reality in different ways
  Confrontational Stance:
    - The three human factions are in full confrontation with the Alien Alliance
    - The United Nations and the Federation are wary of each other, secretly vying for resources
    - The Resistance's purist faction is at war with the fallen faction
    - Chaos Gods and Alien Alliance clash at the edge of the Fallen Zone
  Alliance Relationships:
    - UN-Federation wartime alliance (fragile)
    - UN-Resistance purist faction secret support
    - Federation-Resistance purist faction military guidance
    - Resistance fallen faction-Chaos God sacrificial contract
    - Internal species divisions within the Alien Alliance intensify

Key Areas:
  Political Landscape:
    - UN: Supreme Council rules on the surface, Academy of Sciences controls in secret
    - Federation: Military Commander dictatorship, generals' meeting balances power
    - Resistance: Former UN General Aiden leads the purist faction, fallen sorcerer Marek leads the fallen faction
  Military Situation:
    - UN fleet is technologically advanced but lacks manpower
    - Federation fleet is numerous but has difficulty with supplies
    - Resistance's guerrilla tactics are flexible but organization is chaotic
    - Alien Alliance's bio-warships are expanding rapidly
  Economic Situation:
    - Energy crystal reserves can only last for 15 years
    - Wartime rationing is widely implemented, corruption is rampant in the Core Region
    - Black market resource trading has become the main economic form in the Fallen Zone
  Cultural Situation:
    - UN: Faith in technology and worship of order
    - Federation: Worship of sacrifice and legion honor
    - Resistance purist faction: Will of revenge
    - Resistance fallen faction: Chaos God worship

Important Events:
  Landmark Events:
    - "Black Sun Outbreak" (3060): The first Warp rift destroyed a star system
    - "Ragnar Campaign" (3071): The Federation collectively sacrificed ten thousand generals and soldiers, repelling the Alien Alliance's main force
    - "Star Ring Anomaly" (3075): Multiple warship commanders report unknown voices appearing in Warp communication
  Ongoing Events:
    - "Soul Plague": Soul erosion leads to the mental breakdown of people in the frontier region
    - "Rift Valley Operation": The UN secretly investigates Warp anomalies
    - "Corruption Tide": The influence of Chaos Gods periodically strengthens, leading to rift expansion
  Potential Risks:
    - "Mechanical Zero": The critical point for the collapse of the anti-matter engine predicted by the UN Academy of Sciences
    - "Red Sacrifice": The Federation's planned large-scale sacrificial operation
    - "Four Gods Converge": The danger signal that the sphere of influence of the four major Chaos Gods is overlapping
    - "Zetan Jump": The indication that the Alien Alliance's main fleet is advancing towards the Frontier Region

Special Mechanisms:
  Mysterious Contract:
    - The protagonist establishes a secret contract with FGO Servants through unknown Warp encounters
    - This contract is completely unknown to existing forces, breaking conventional rules
    - The strength of the contract is directly proportional to intimacy and the degree of soul erosion
    - The contract brings unique abilities but also carries the risk of soul erosion
  Warp Erosion Map:
    - Fallen Zone erosion rate 80%, dense rifts, hallucinations are common
    - Frontier Region erosion rate 35%, rifts appear occasionally, true thoughts begin to emerge
    - Core Region erosion rate 10%, rifts are rare, highly modified individuals are susceptible
