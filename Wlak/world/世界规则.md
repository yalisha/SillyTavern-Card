Basic Physical Rules:
  Spacetime Laws:
    - Time Flow and Characteristics: Time flows linearly in the real universe, while it is chaotic and disordered in the Warp.
    - Spatial Structure and Dimensions: Reality is a three-dimensional space, while the Warp is a higher-dimensional chaotic realm.
    - Spacetime Interaction Laws: Warp jumps connect real star regions, accompanied by the risk of soul erosion.
    - Relationship Between Position and Distance: On a galactic scale, distances are measured in light-years, and faster-than-light travel relies on the Warp.
  Matter and Energy Laws:
    - Basic Physical Laws: Newtonian mechanics and relativity apply to the real universe.
    - Forms of Energy and Transformation: Anti-matter engines are the primary energy source, and Warp energy is in a chaotic state.
    - Properties and States of Matter: Real matter is stable, while Warp energy entities are corrosive.
    - Mechanisms of Force: Gravity and electromagnetic force dominate reality, while Warp forces distort real laws.
  Life Laws:
    - Definition of Life Essence: Carbon-based life is dominant, and the soul is the link between consciousness and the Warp.
    - Rules for Determining Life and Death: Physical death marks the end of life, and the soul can be captured by the Warp.
    - Basic Physiological Mechanisms: Humans depend on oxygen and food, and soul erosion depletes the spirit.
    - Laws of Aging and Regeneration: Natural aging occurs over about 100 years, and psychic powers accelerate mental decline.
  Special Physical Rules:
    - Unique Physical Phenomena: Warp rifts cause reality to distort (e.g., gravitational anomalies).
    - Special Forms of Energy: Chaos energy is corrosive and requires a contract or summoning to manifest.

Life Propagation Rules:
  Basic Propagation Laws:
    - Methods of Species Continuation: Humans continue through natural reproduction.
    - Laws of Genetic Variation: Follows Mendelian inheritance, with psychics exhibiting a tendency for mutation.
    - Laws of Life Cycle: Birth-maturity-aging-death, soul erosion shortens the cycle.
    - Laws of Population Development: War and corruption lead to a sharp decline in the population.
  Gender and Reproduction:
    - Gender Division System: Binary gender system of male and female.
    - Laws of Sexual Maturity: Enters sexual maturity at approximately 15 years of age.
    - Rules of Reproductive Capacity: Normal birth rate, war reduces survival rate.
    - Determination of Offspring Characteristics: Primarily genetic, psychic powers have randomness.

Supernatural Rules:
  Mysterious Powers:
    - Classification of Superpowers: Primarily psychic powers (Warp communication), accompanied by soul erosion.
    - Acquisition of Special Abilities: Awakened through contracts with Servants or Chaos Gods.
    - Restrictions on Power Usage: Using psychic powers exacerbates erosion, and overuse leads to mental breakdown.
    - Side Effect Mechanisms: Hallucinations, true thoughts, crisis of trust.
  Magic System:
    - Essence and Source of Magic Power: Warp chaos energy, FGO Servants are the embodiment medium.
    - Conditions and Restrictions for Casting: The contract between the protagonist and the Servant is unique and requires intimacy support.
    - Laws of Magic Effects: Servant power weakens Chaos God hallucinations, at the cost of soul erosion.
    - Magic Power Recovery Mechanism: Increased intimacy or victory in battle restores power.

Social Interaction Rules:
  Power Rules:
    - Source and Distribution of Power: The United Nations relies on technology, the Federation relies on military strength, and the Resistance relies on the leader's charisma.
    - Mechanisms of Rule and Obedience: Centralization and military control coexist, the Resistance has loose obedience.
    - Power Check and Balance System: The United Nations and the Federation are wary of each other, with no effective check.
    - Laws of Power Succession: Rebellions or sacrifices lead to succession.
  Resource Rules:
    - Production and Disappearance of Resources: Energy crystals are the key resource, depleted by war.
    - Allocation and Exchange Mechanisms: Primarily rationing, trade between alliances is limited.
    - Value Assessment System: Survival is the priority, technology and military force determine value.
    - Laws of Scarcity: Resources are scarce in the Fallen Zone, relatively abundant in the core region.
  Relationship Rules:
    - Formation of Social Relationships: Primarily based on comradeship and contractual relationships.
    - Mechanisms of Emotional Connection: The protagonist and the Servant build trust through true thoughts and combat.
    - Rules for Establishing Trust: Joint victories and revealing intentions strengthen trust.
    - Handling of Contradictions and Conflicts: Betrayal and sacrifice are the main sources of conflict.

    - Methods of Knowledge Preservation: Databases are often damaged by war.
    - Laws for Acquiring Skills: Skills are accumulated through practical experience.
    - Forgetting and Memory: Soul erosion causes memory confusion.

    - Mechanisms of Lying Effects: Chaos God hallucinations confuse the truth.
    - Information Verification System: Communication is easily interfered with by the Warp.
    - Reliability of Memory: Soul erosion reduces reliability.

Change Rules:
  Development Laws:
    - Mechanisms of Progress and Regression: Technological progress is limited by war and corruption.
    - Balance and Imbalance: Human forces are unbalanced, and Chaos God forces are expanding.
    - Adaptation and Elimination: Psychics adapt to the environment, the weak are eliminated.
    - Cycles and Replacement: War and corruption cycle repeatedly.
